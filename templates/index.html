        <h2>Artificial Intelligence and Future</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is already a part of everyday life, from wearable health technology like smart
          watches and voice assistants to self-driving cars and chat bots. And this trend is only expected to continue
          growing. In fact, according to the Brookings Institution, in just over a decade, AI will outperform humans in
          a variety of tasks, from writing essays to retail work. The future of AI will feature a shift of traditionally
          human-driven operations to work performed by automated computers.

          The predicted impact of artificial intelligence on people, business, and industry in coming years is profound,
          and while some may worry about the dangers of over-automation, there are actually many positive social and
          economic benefits to AI. If you’re considering a career in programming or other computer professions, you’ll
          be in a position to use AI to potentially solve a variety of human problems across sectors, including
          humanitarian crises, healthcare needs, and quality control in areas such as manufacturing or product
          development.

        <p>According to a PricewaterhouseCoopers survey, 20% of organizations plan to implement AI in their enterprise
          in 2019. The implications of this trend are significant, as they imply that AI is no longer confined to
          research or computer labs. Instead, AI will impact offices, hospitals, and consumer products. Machine
          learning, biometrics, and prescriptive analytics are a few ways professionals apply AI in industrial settings,
          business offices, and laboratories.

          Businesses use machine learning — the ability of computer programs to refine their abilities based on pattern
          recognition — to help interpret and analyze a vast amount of customer data. As the future of AI becomes more
          accurate and efficient, companies use these insights to create more personalized content for their customers
          and audiences. Additionally, AI can determine which marketing channels are performing best based on how
          potential customers engage with content. Then, the AI can automatically allocate additional marketing dollars
          to the most viable audiences.</p>
